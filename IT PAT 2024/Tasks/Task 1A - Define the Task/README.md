# TASK 1A: Define the TASK

## Project Overview: A Seamless Property Search Application
In our fast-paced world, finding the perfect property - whether for sale or rent - can be overwhelming. Traditional search methods involve manual trawling between platforms, leading to inefficiency and frustration. Our solution aims to transform real estate hunting by creating a location-based real estate market application.

### Key Features
- **Map-based search**: Our application seamlessly integrates maps and geolocation services. Users can enter any location in South Africa and acquire properties within a specific radius. Visual search simplifies the search process.
  
- **Advanced Filters**: Refinement of search results is crucial. Users can apply filters based on price range, property type, bedrooms, and other criteria. This precision ensures customized results.
  
- **Property Information Screen**: Each property listing contains important information: address, price, square footage, and services. Users can quickly assess whether a property meets their needs.
  
- **User interaction**: Convenience is important. Users can save favourite searches, receive timely notifications of new listings, and communicate directly with sellers, all within the application.

## Scope of the Project
- **User interface design**: We create an intuitive user interface that simplifies property searches and improves the overall user experience. Clear design ensures easy navigation.
  
- **Database Integration**: Our application uses a database. It stores comprehensive information about assets including details, agent information, and transaction history.
  
- **User Authentication**: Security is important. We implement strong user authentication to allow users to create accounts and log in securely.
  
- **Functionality Implementation**: From smart search algorithms to stylish real estate displays, we ensure unparalleled functionality across the app.

By curating the property search according to the user's location preference, our app aims to make finding suitable properties easy. Whether it's a cozy apartment or a spacious house, our simplified approach makes the job of the home seeker easier.
